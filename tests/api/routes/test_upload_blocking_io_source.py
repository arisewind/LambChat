"""Upload routes must keep CPU/IO-heavy hashing off the event loop.

Source-structure test: sha256 hashing of upload payloads (per-chunk during
spooling and one-shot over transcoded image bytes) runs in the blocking-io
pool via run_long_blocking_io, and every remaining sync open()/PIL render path in
the upload route family stays wrapped as well.
