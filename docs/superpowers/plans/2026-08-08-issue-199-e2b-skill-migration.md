# Issue #199 E2B and Skill Migration Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Complete issue #199 by making the E2B template build/verification path executable, safely migrating obsolete docx skill instructions, and rolling out a verified immutable template with rollback.

**Architecture:** Refactor the existing E2B build script into testable template/build/verify functions using the installed `e2b` SDK, and add a bounded dry-run-first MongoDB migration with compare-and-swap plus expiring backups. External rollout builds a uniquely tagged candidate, verifies its immutable build reference, pins `.env`, restarts only existing services, and restores the previous value on failed health checks.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12+, E2B SDK 2.x, Motor/MongoDB, pytest/pytest-asyncio, Ruff, zsh operational checks.

---

### Task 1: Repair and unit-test the E2B template builder

**Files:**
- Modify: `scripts/create_e2b_template.py`
- Create: `tests/scripts/test_create_e2b_template.py`
- Modify: `.gitignore`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing builder tests**

Import the script under pytest and use fake `Template`/builder objects. Assert it imports `Template` from `e2b`, starts from `code-interpreter-v1`, emits an apt command containing `ripgrep` and `librsvg2-bin`, installs the declared pip packages, and calls `Template.build` with a unique candidate tag, CPU/memory values, API key, and build logger. With a fake `SettingsService`, assert the CLI resolves `E2B_API_KEY` database-first and never prints it.

```python
def test_template_apt_step_installs_issue_199_commands():
    builder = _RecordingBuilder()
    build_template(builder)
    apt = next(cmd for cmd in builder.commands if "apt-get install" in cmd)
    assert "ripgrep" in apt
    assert "librsvg2-bin" in apt
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests and verify RED**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/scripts/test_create_e2b_template.py -q`

Expected: the current script fails because `e2b_code_interpreter` is unavailable or the testable functions do not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Refactor to minimal testable functions**

Add `.gitignore` exceptions for the tracked operational scripts in this plan. Use `from e2b import Template, default_build_logger`. Add `build_template()`, `build_candidate(candidate_tag, api_key)`, and an argparse CLI. Resolve the build key through `SettingsService.get_raw("E2B_API_KEY")`, which honors database-first configuration. Build under name `lambchat-prod` with a unique candidate tag such as `candidate-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`; write a UUID `rollout_id`, the SDK-returned template/build IDs, and immutable reference to an ignored `workspace/e2b-rollouts/<candidate>.json` manifest, but never the API key. Keep `main()` as a thin async validation/CLI wrapper.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests and verify GREEN**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/scripts/test_create_e2b_template.py -q`

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add .gitignore scripts/create_e2b_template.py tests/scripts/test_create_e2b_template.py
git commit -m "fix: make E2B template builder executable"
```

### Task 2: Add cleanup-safe manifest verification and effective-config guards

**Files:**
- Modify: `scripts/create_e2b_template.py`
- Modify: `tests/scripts/test_create_e2b_template.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing verifier tests**

Use a fake sandbox whose `commands.run` records calls. Assert `verify_manifest(path)` reads the immutable reference from the build manifest, checks `command -v rg`, `command -v rsvg-convert`, writes a tiny SVG, converts it to PNG, and validates a non-empty output. Assert `sandbox.kill()` runs in `finally` on success and command failure. Assert successful verification atomically writes `verified_at` and `verified_build_id` to the same manifest. A failed smoke test must leave those fields absent and cannot promote tags.

With fake `system_settings` storage and a temporary `.env`, test first-pin CAS, idempotent retry, rejection of a concurrent administrator value, and preservation of the original database-document existence/value plus env line. Test restore deletes a rollout-created database document when none existed, restores an existing document when it did, refuses after a later edit, and clears `pinned_ref`, effective-config evidence, and health evidence. Test `verify_effective_configuration` and `record_health` reject any manifest/config mismatch. Test `promote_manifest` reads the reference only from the fully verified manifest and re-reads the database-first effective value immediately before tagging; stale manifest evidence after a restore or administrator edit must fail promotion.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run verifier tests and verify RED**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/scripts/test_create_e2b_template.py -q`

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement verification and explicit promotion**

Add `verify_manifest(manifest_path, api_key)` using `Sandbox.create(manifest["immutable_ref"], timeout=300, api_key=...)`. Run one shell command with `set -euo pipefail`, both `command -v` checks, a temporary SVG, `rsvg-convert`, and `test -s`. Kill the sandbox in `finally` and atomically update only that manifest on success.

Add async `pin_effective_configuration(manifest_path, env_file)` that treats MongoDB `system_settings.E2B_TEMPLATE` as authoritative and `.env` only as fallback. On the first pin it records, exactly once, whether a database document existed, its previous value/update metadata, the prior `.env` line, and the environment-file path. It then compare-and-swaps the database setting to the immutable candidate, aligns the `.env` fallback, publishes the setting change, and records `pinned_ref`. A second call is idempotent only when the manifest and both sources already equal the candidate; it must never overwrite the original rollback baseline. Any unrelated current value causes a conflict and abort.

Add the inverse `restore_effective_configuration(manifest_path)`, also compare-and-swap guarded: restore the saved database document or delete the rollout-created document when none existed, restore the saved `.env` fallback, publish the setting change, refuse to overwrite a later administrator edit, and atomically invalidate `pinned_ref`, `effective_ref_verified_at`, `health_checked_at`, plus their associated build/reference fields in the manifest.

Add `verify_effective_configuration(manifest_path)` using `SettingsService.get_raw("E2B_TEMPLATE")`; it records `effective_ref_verified_at` only when the database-first value equals the manifest immutable reference. Add `record_health(manifest_path, health_url)` that performs the health request itself and records `health_checked_at` only after verified build, pin, and effective-config evidence all match. Add `promote_manifest(manifest_path, api_key)` that accepts no caller-provided template reference, refuses unless every preceding manifest field matches, then re-reads `SettingsService.get_raw("E2B_TEMPLATE")` and requires it still equals the immutable reference immediately before calling `Template.assign_tags(manifest["immutable_ref"], "production", api_key=...)`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests and verify GREEN**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/scripts/test_create_e2b_template.py -q`

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add scripts/create_e2b_template.py tests/scripts/test_create_e2b_template.py
git commit -m "feat: verify E2B template candidates safely"
```

### Task 3: Implement dry-run-first docx skill path migration

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/migrate_docx_skill_paths.py`
- Create: `tests/scripts/test_migrate_docx_skill_paths.py`
- Modify: `.gitignore`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing recognition and rewrite tests**

Create fake async collections following `tests/infra/skill/test_legacy_migration_limits.py`. Cover normalized `SKILL.md` records in `skill_files` and `skill_marketplace_files`, legacy `system_skills.content`, and the exact obsolete path. Assert auxiliary/script files, missing `file_path`, and non-docx paths are ambiguous and block apply. Assert the canonical transfer block and placeholder are inserted exactly once.

```python
def test_rewrite_inserts_transfer_instructions_once():
    migrated = rewrite_skill_instructions(LEGACY_COMMAND)
    assert "transfer_path" in migrated
    assert "/skills/docx/" in migrated
    assert "<transferred-docx-skill-dir>/scripts/office/validate.py" in migrated
    assert rewrite_skill_instructions(migrated) == migrated
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run recognition tests and verify RED**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/scripts/test_migrate_docx_skill_paths.py -q`

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement bounded scan and dry-run report**

Add a `.gitignore` exception for `scripts/migrate_docx_skill_paths.py`. Query only documents containing the exact old path, project `_id`, `file_path`, and `content`, and apply `.batch_size(100)`. Return counts for recognized, ambiguous, migrated, conflicted, and rolled_back without contents or user IDs. The CLI defaults to dry-run and requires `--apply`; any ambiguous count makes apply exit nonzero before writes.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests and verify GREEN**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/scripts/test_migrate_docx_skill_paths.py -q`

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add .gitignore scripts/migrate_docx_skill_paths.py tests/scripts/test_migrate_docx_skill_paths.py
git commit -m "feat: detect legacy docx skill paths"
```

### Task 4: Add compare-and-swap backups and rollback

**Files:**
- Modify: `scripts/migrate_docx_skill_paths.py`
- Modify: `tests/scripts/test_migrate_docx_skill_paths.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing apply/rollback tests**

Assert apply requires a unique rollout manifest/ID, creates an idempotent `skill_migration_backups` record before source update, creates a TTL index on `expire_at` with `expireAfterSeconds=0`, and updates with `{"_id": id, "content": original}`. Simulate a crash immediately after the source CAS and assert rollback still discovers the backup by the manifest's unique rollout ID. Assert a CAS miss increments `conflicted`. Assert rollback queries every backup for only the supplied manifest's rollout ID and restores only when the current content SHA-256 equals `migrated_content_hash`; backups whose source CAS never happened, later edits, and backups from an earlier rollout ID are reported and untouched. Assert a second apply has zero pending changes.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests and verify RED**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/scripts/test_migrate_docx_skill_paths.py -q`

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement backups, CAS, and `--rollback`**

Use a stable migration-kind ID plus the unique `rollout_id` generated in the E2B build manifest. The backup unique key is migration-kind/rollout/collection/source ID. Set `expire_at=utc_now()+timedelta(days=30)`. Insert/upsert the complete backup before each source CAS. `--apply --manifest <path>` and `--rollback --manifest <path>` are mutually exclusive; rollback queries all and only backups with the manifest's rollout ID, then applies the migrated hash guard. This makes the backup itself the durable rollback registry and removes any crash window between the source CAS and a second filesystem-manifest write.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run tests and verify GREEN**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/scripts/test_migrate_docx_skill_paths.py -q`

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add scripts/migrate_docx_skill_paths.py tests/scripts/test_migrate_docx_skill_paths.py
git commit -m "feat: migrate docx skill paths with rollback"
```

### Task 5: Propagate E2B settings in supported Compose deployment

**Files:**
- Modify: `deploy/docker-compose.yml`
- Modify: `deploy/.env.example`
- Create: `tests/deploy/test_docker_compose_sandbox_env.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write a failing Compose environment test**

Load `deploy/docker-compose.yml` with `yaml.safe_load` and assert the `lambchat` service passes both `E2B_API_KEY=${E2B_API_KEY:-}` and `E2B_TEMPLATE=${E2B_TEMPLATE:-base}`. Assert `deploy/.env.example` documents both variables without a real key.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test and verify RED**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/deploy/test_docker_compose_sandbox_env.py -q`

- [ ] **Step 3: Add only the required Compose environment mappings**

Add the two variables to `lambchat.environment` and safe placeholders to `deploy/.env.example`. Do not expose the host key in committed files.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the test and verify GREEN**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/deploy/test_docker_compose_sandbox_env.py -q`

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add deploy/docker-compose.yml deploy/.env.example tests/deploy/test_docker_compose_sandbox_env.py
git commit -m "fix: pass E2B template settings to Compose"
```

### Task 6: Run repository verification and migration preflight

**Files:**
- Modify only if a regression is found: files from Tasks 1-5

- [ ] **Step 1: Run focused tests**

```bash
uv run pytest tests/scripts/test_create_e2b_template.py tests/scripts/test_migrate_docx_skill_paths.py tests/deploy/test_docker_compose_sandbox_env.py tests/infra/backend/test_e2b_glob.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run Ruff**

```bash
uv run ruff check scripts/create_e2b_template.py scripts/migrate_docx_skill_paths.py tests/scripts/test_create_e2b_template.py tests/scripts/test_migrate_docx_skill_paths.py tests/deploy/test_docker_compose_sandbox_env.py
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the migration live dry-run**

Run: `uv run python scripts/migrate_docx_skill_paths.py`

Expected for the currently configured database: zero matches and no writes. If ambiguous matches exist, stop rollout, repair them manually, and rerun dry-run; do not use `--apply` while ambiguity remains.

- [ ] **Step 4: Record preflight counts without applying yet**

Candidate build and smoke verification must succeed before any MongoDB write. Save only the aggregate recognized/ambiguous counts for the later rollout step.

### Task 7: Build, verify, migrate, switch, and promote one manifest-bound candidate

**Files:**
- Modify external/untracked configuration only after successful verification: `.env`

- [ ] **Step 1: Capture prior config and running service set**

Use `SettingsService.get_raw("E2B_TEMPLATE")` to record the database-first effective template without echoing other settings. Separately record the fallback `.env` line and running LambChat backend/worker process identifiers or container/service names using read-only commands. Do not start previously stopped services.

- [ ] **Step 2: Build a uniquely tagged candidate and manifest**

Run: `uv run python scripts/create_e2b_template.py build`

Capture the emitted manifest path. All subsequent commands accept that manifest path and no manually copied build reference.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify the immutable candidate**

Run: `uv run python scripts/create_e2b_template.py verify --manifest '<manifest-path>'`

Expected: `rg`, `rsvg-convert`, and SVG conversion all pass; the temporary sandbox is killed.

- [ ] **Step 4: Apply the migration only after candidate verification**

If preflight reported recognized matches, run `uv run python scripts/migrate_docx_skill_paths.py --apply --manifest '<manifest-path>'`, then require a zero-match dry-run. If preflight was zero, skip writes. Every backup is keyed by the unique rollout ID already stored in this manifest, so rollback is conditional, crash-safe, and scoped to this rollout.

- [ ] **Step 5: Pin `.env` and recreate only a running Compose app**

Select the environment file actually used by the detected runtime and run `uv run python scripts/create_e2b_template.py pin-config --manifest '<manifest-path>' --env-file '<env-file>'`; do not copy the build reference manually. This command compare-and-swaps the database-first `system_settings` value and aligns the `.env` fallback while preserving the first rollback baseline.

If `docker compose --env-file '<env-file>' -f deploy/docker-compose.yml ps --status running lambchat` shows the app running, first validate interpolation with `docker compose --env-file '<env-file>' -f deploy/docker-compose.yml config`, then use `docker compose --env-file '<env-file>' -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --force-recreate --no-deps lambchat`; plain `restart` is forbidden because it does not reload environment. Run `uv run python scripts/create_e2b_template.py verify-effective --manifest '<manifest-path>'` to require the database-first value to equal the candidate, then run the health check.

If no app service is running, do not start one; the pinned setting applies on the next start. If a native `main.py` process is running without a supervisor, stop and ask for the exact restart mechanism rather than killing it heuristically; do not promote until the running process has been demonstrably restarted with the manifest reference.

- [ ] **Step 6: Roll back config and migrated data on failed health**

On any failure after migration apply, run `uv run python scripts/create_e2b_template.py restore-config --manifest '<manifest-path>'`, force-recreate the same Compose service with the same explicit `--env-file` when applicable, run `uv run python scripts/migrate_docx_skill_paths.py --rollback --manifest '<manifest-path>'`, verify effective configuration, recovery health, and migration counts, and stop. Do not assign the production tag.

- [ ] **Step 7: Record health and promote only through the manifest**

Run:

```bash
uv run python scripts/create_e2b_template.py record-health --manifest '<manifest-path>' --url 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/health'
uv run python scripts/create_e2b_template.py promote --manifest '<manifest-path>'
```

After promotion, query `Template.get_tags("lambchat-prod")` and require the `production` tag to resolve to the manifest's `build_id`; record only the non-secret IDs.

### Task 8: Final combined verification and issue closure

**Files:**
- No repository file changes expected

- [ ] **Step 1: Run combined #198/#199 tests and Ruff**

Use all focused commands from both plans, then run the broader affected suites:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/infra/mcp tests/infra/tool/test_mcp_client.py tests/scripts/test_check_tavily_usage.py tests/scripts/test_create_e2b_template.py tests/scripts/test_migrate_docx_skill_paths.py tests/deploy/test_docker_compose_sandbox_env.py tests/infra/backend/test_e2b_glob.py -q
uv run ruff check src/infra/mcp src/infra/tool/mcp_client.py scripts/check_tavily_usage.py scripts/create_e2b_template.py scripts/migrate_docx_skill_paths.py tests/infra/mcp tests/infra/tool/test_mcp_client.py tests/scripts tests/deploy/test_docker_compose_sandbox_env.py
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Re-fetch issues immediately before writing**

```bash
gh issue view 198 --repo Yanyutin753/LambChat --json state,comments,updatedAt,url
gh issue view 199 --repo Yanyutin753/LambChat --json state,comments,updatedAt,url
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Post verification evidence and close #198/#199**

Summarize code commits, test counts, sanitized Tavily usage probe, E2B immutable build reference, smoke-test commands, health result, and Mongo migration counts. Never include secrets. Close only after all acceptance criteria pass.

- [ ] **Step 4: Confirm the remaining open issue list**

Run: `gh issue list --repo Yanyutin753/LambChat --state open --limit 100`

Confirm #158 remains open as an empty bug-collection tracker and #203 remains an enhancement request; do not close either as a code bug.
